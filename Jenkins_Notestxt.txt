General - Souce code management- build triggers - build environment - build - postbuild actions 

Github actions 
--Running jenkins 
go to location 
run command
java -jar jenkins -war -httpport=8081 
tomat server : port 5050 
login to jenkins 
admin - admin 

-Manager jenkins 
check for available plugins 
deploy 

pom.xml 
Need to create a job 
package is war 

spring framework package

springboot job
fresstyple project 
--Sourcecode managemt - git , bit bucket 
credentials 

---build triggers 

* * * * * - every minute 
poll for github changes 

--build environment
delete workspace 
Invoke top level maven targets 
maven goal
***clean compile package 
package to war file 


--Post build actions 
deploy plugin 

Deploy war to container - depends on plugin installation 

containers : 

Glassfish , Jboss , Tomcat conatinter 

Add the required credentials 

URL 

Build now to run jenkins job 

runnig job 
jeniks workspace will be deleted 

now war file will be available in web apps folder 

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that runs Java-based applications. It's a popular choice for developers because it's lightweight, easy to set up, and works with many operating systems. 

Spring Boot is a Java framework that helps developers create and run applications more easily. It's an extension of the Spring framework, which is an open-source application framework for building Java applications. 


Step 1: Install & Configure Jenkins
2.Install Plugins
Pipeline
Git
Docker
Kubernetes
SonarQube Scanner
JFrog Artifactory
Slack Notification
Email Extension Plugin
Blue Ocean (for pipeline visualization)

Step 3: Jenkinsfile (Pipeline Script)

Step 4: Integrating Additional Tools

Step 5: Trigger Automation
Git Webhooks: Automatically trigger builds on code changes
Cron Jobs: Schedule builds at specific times
Manual Triggers: Start pipeline manually when required

Step 6: Monitor & Optimize
Use Jenkins Blue Ocean for pipeline visualization
Monitor logs in Jenkins Console Output
Enable Jenkins Dashboard Metrics
Optimize with parallel stages and caching dependencies

By following these steps, you can create a fully automated CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins integrating Git, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, JFrog, Slack, Email, and more. You can customize this based on your project's needs.

#####23-Jan ####
Nana : 
What is Jenkins file ?
pipeline as a code 
agent - windows or linux node 
stages and steps : 
build stage , test stage - deploy stage .
java script - npm install ,npm build in build stage 
multi branch pipeline - freestyle project 
branch - select git repo 
credentials 

post build 
condition - always -success - failure 
like sending build or something 
Env variables - branch name = dev 

localhost:8080/env-variables.html 
credentials binding plugin 

Global credentials 

#Using Tools attribute for making build tools available
maven, gradle or yarn 
gradle, maven and jdk 


#Using Parameters for a Parameterized Build
Android - apk 
java - .jar file 
writing code - compiling to form a build 


 stage('Checkout Code') 
 stage('Build Docker Image') 
 stage('Push to Docker Hub') 
 stage('Deploy to Amazon Linux')

1. Prerequisites and installation
2. Jenkins typical configurations
3. Create new users and manage permissions
4. Build freestyle jobs and auto-schedule its run

plugins is heart and soul of jenkins 
 
Web application written in java - can be installed in 3 ways : 
 -Windows or Linux unix services 
 -Generic war file 
 -Install on any Java bases web servers - Apache TomCat
 
 pre-requuisite ;
 jdk - 
 2GB RAM 
 JAVA HOME Env variable 
 
 -Install suggested plugins 
 -first time login 
 
###default plugins 
git -repo 
svn
github 
ant 
email extension 
groovy 
gradle 
mailer 
Folders 

Create admin and other users 
Jenkins will be ready now 

First time configurations : 

#####Manage Jenkins : 
Number of executors : how many threads can be run in this particular system 

SMTP Server details 
to send emails 
email id we can set up for jenkin server 
Test configuration of email 

#Global Tool configurations -Conitnuous integration system 
JDK 
git 
Gradle 
Maven 


##GLobal Security 
LDAP Server ?
Authentication server - AD 

Will create new job now 
-General 
-SourceCodeManagement-
-Build Triggers 
-Build Environment
-Build 
-PostBuildActions 

Execute windows batch command

Second Job :
Build Triggers - > Build periodically 

###Role Based Access Plugin - to create few roles 
Manage Jenkins  - Manage Plugins 
it will be available in global security 
Enable it 
manage and assign roles 
this option we can see only after installing the plugin 

Roles _ Global role,project role , slave roles 
Jenkins is owned or controlled by QA guys 
Little permission for developer role 
Created Global role called developer 

Manager jenkins - manage users 
Assign developer role to newly created user 

logout and login with developer user 


5. Integrate GitHub with Jenkins
6. SMTP configuration for sending emails
7. Deploy Maven based web-app to Tomcat server
8. Distributed build: Master-slave configuration and set-up
9. Backing up Jenkins


#############Plugins 
-maven and java 
-MSBuild
-Github
-AWS 
-Docker 
-SonarQube -static code anaysis 

Git repo
Configure url to pull code 
provide credentials 
exeucte windows batch command
java -c hellojava 
java hello 


maven build tool next 
mvn 
tomcat webserver 
maven should be download and path should be set in Jenkins box 
it can be our laptop as well 

download and install apache tomcat server 
Configure the port to run in other than port 8080 
by editing server.xml file 
create tomcat users 
start the tomcat server 

New job creation - 3rd Job 
Mvn_web_app

mvn package 
it is a target 
warfile will get generated in a location 

grab this war file and deploy it to tomcat server 

Download Deploy to conatainer plugin 

Now we will add post build step : 
Tomcat is a container ( you can check the list in jenkins ) 

URL of tomcat 
localhost:8081 

if we give diff IP , build will be copied to that server and deployed 

###Distributed build --Master Slave ###6-Feb-2025 ###
Master
Windows 
Linux 
Mac 

JNLB - Java Network Lauch protocol - to talk to slave Jenkins 
enable TCP - JNLB port 

Manage Nodes : 
New Node - Windows Node 
# of executores : 2 
label expressions matching the node 

run some command from agent command line 
agent.jar 

status shows connected now : 
it will create workspace in root folder - agent/slave 
create delegate to agent job 
how to run on agent ?
restrict where this project can be run 

#####9. Backing up Jenkins
-back up program files - jenkins folder
or use plugin 
Manage jenkins 
- install one of backup plugin 
backup - restrore hudson configuration 

######jenkins interview questions 
Popular Open Source Automation Server 

-Jenkins master pulls the code from github repo everytime there is a code commit
-It distributes the workload to all Jenkin slaves
-on request from jenkins master ,the slaves carry out builds and tests and produce the reports 

Jenkins File : 
Text file that contains defnition of Jenkins file and checked into source control repo 
-allows code review and itertion on pipeline
-permits audit trail for the pipeline
-there is a single source of truth for the pipeline which can be viewed and edited

java -jar jenkins.war 

key aspects 
-pipeline: user defined model of cd pipeline .pipelines code define entire build process .
-node
-step : a single task that tells jenkins what to do at a particular point in time 
-stage : defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire pipeline ( build,test,deploy ) stages

2 types of pipeline 
- scripting [ groovy script ] 
- delclarative 

3 . Backu up Jenkins_Home directory 
or back up plugin 

4. How to copy job from one server to other ?
copy the jobs directory from old server to new one 

4.Security mecahaism to authencate jenkins user 
-it uses internal DB to store credentials
-LDAP server 
-authentication mechanism of application server 

5. Hot to deploy custom build of core plugin 

temporarily we can disable jenkins security 

--ways in which build can be scheduled in jenkins 
-by source code management commits 
-after completion of other builds-
-schedule to run at specific times
-manual build requests 

jenkins restart
force and safe restart

Rebuild, using the Rebuilder plugin allows a completed job to be re-executed while allowing you to change the parameters, assuming your job is parameterized.

Replay does something similar, except it doesn't show you parameters. Instead, it shows the pipeline code directly. This is helpful when wanting to test changes iteratively as you can click Replay, change one or two lines of code, then let it execute. The job will run using the same parameters as it did the first time it ran/completed.
