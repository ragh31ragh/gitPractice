container technologies

Docker , Google Kubernetes Engine,Openshift -Redhat 

docker vs virtual machines

container - container config, dependencies etc 
Docker - Virtualization Tool 

How is OS made up 
OS Kernel 
OS Applications Layer 

docker virtualizes applicaiton layer 

VM has its own kernerl - not docker .it virtualizes complete OS 

10-Jan-2025 :
Docker can be installed on desktop - windows os also

docker cli - docker ui avaialbe 

KAOps

docker hub 
docker official images 
docker images
docker ps
docker pull nginx:1.23

docker run nginx:1.23 

if name is not provided to container docker will give name like "volsome_holard"

docker run -d nginx:1.23
-d detach mode .


docker logs id/container name 


we can directly run docker command

docker pulls image automatically , if it doesnot find locally 

Port Binding : 
Container Port vs host port 

docker run -d -p 9000:80 nignx:1.23 



mysql 3306:3306 

docker run 
creates a new conainer doesnot use previous one .

docker run --name devops -d -p 9000:80 ngingx:1.23 

need to authenticate before using private registry 

docker registry / vs repository 

registr - a service providing storage
-collection of repository
repos 
-collection of related images with same name but diff versions

Building our own docker images 

Docker - Build instruction :
Dockerfile is text document that contains command to assemble an image
docker can build an image by reading those instructions 

starts with base image
FROM node:19-alpine
COPY package.json /app/
COPY src /app/
WORKDIR 
RUN npm install 

cd is WORKDIR here 


docker build -t nodeapp:1.0 

Docker in completer software development lifecycle 



###AWS VPC Explained 
To securely isolate and control network environments

VPC CIDR Block 
When you create a VPC , you specify a CIDR block that defined the IP Address range for the Entire VPC 
For Example  : 

10.0.0.0/16
This blocks allows for 65536 IP Addresses, But in reality 65,531 are usable addresses
CIDR [Classless InterDomain Routing] is a method for allocating IP Addresses and routing Internet protocol packets 

A subnet is a smaller , segmented part of a larger network that isolates and organizes devices within a specific IP address range 

instances will be created inside subnet 

public subnet 10.0.0.0/24
private subnet 10.0.1.0/24

subnet will be created in AZ 

Subnet CIDR Blocks 

Routing Table 
Routing table is set of rules called routes .that are used to dertermine whether network traffic from your subnets or gateway is directed 
Each subnet from your VPC  must be associated with a route table , which controls ther routing of the subnet .

Internet Gateway : 
An Internet gateway is a component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet .

Security Groups:-works on instance level 
Network firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances .

Security group contains inbound and outbound rules 
inbound - enable http and https 

Network ACLs ( Access Control Lists)- works on subnet level 
Optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets 

Allow or Deny Rule 

NAT ( Network Address Translator ) Gateway :
Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS Services .but prevents the internet from initiating 
connection to those instances 

VPC Peering 
A networking connection between 2 VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately 

VPC Endpoints 
Allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS Private Link 

Bastion Hosts : 
A special purpose instance that provides secure access to your instances in private subnet 


Elastic IP Addresses : 
Static IP Addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing 

VPC Flow Logs : 
Captures Information about the IP Traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC 

Direct Connect : 
Establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS 

AWS Client VPN : 
Managed VPN service that enables secure remote access to AWS resurces and on premise networks using Open VPN based clients 

####Manual VPC Cretion 
Create new VPC
created 2 subnets
1 public and another private .

Create route table 
Create Internet Gateway 

####VPC Creation using TF
A VPC with CIDR Block of 10.0.0.0/16
One public subnet with CIDR block of 10.0.1.0/24
One private subnet with CIDR block of 10.0.2.0/24 
One Internet Gateway 
One public route table with a route to the Internet Gateway , and the correct association between public subnet and public route table 

everything will be created in aws-vpc folder 
In new folder will perform terraform init
