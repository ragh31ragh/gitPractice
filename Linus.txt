centos , ubuntu , amazon linux 2 3 
Step 1: Installing Docker as the container runtime Interface
#update the repository
sudo apt-get update

#uninstall any old Docker software
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io

#Install docker
sudo apt install docker.io

#Start and automate docker to start at run time
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

#verify docker installation
docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

Step 2: Installing kubeadm tool
#add the required repository for kubeadm
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF

#update the repository
$ sudo apt-get update

#installing kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl

#setting apt-mark
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

kubeadm init will initialize this machine to make it as master.

$ kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr 10.13.0.0/16

########5-Feb-2025 
/ 
is root directory 

OS store and manage data on disk or partitions using a structure called filesystem 
FileSystem include files , directories and related permissions 

There is no issue with extension in linux  you can store file with anyname 
case sensitive 

Types of file system :
1.ext3
2.ext4
3.XFS
4.BtrFs
5.FAT 

How to check your filesystem 
lsblk -f
df -Th ( check for filesystem)
cat /etc/fstab 

XFS vs EXT4 
-Optimized for large files and volumes,offering superior performance and scalability 

EXT4
-performs well across various file sizes but less efficient with extremely large files 

What is inode ?
Linux datastructure that stores metadata about file directory 

ls -li 
inode number 

Filesystem structure : 
forward slash / root directory 
############6-Feb-2025
/bin: contains essential user binaries (executables ) such as common commands like ls,cp etc 
all commands and logic of commands 


/etc 
Holds the system configuration files 
User , Network services , System Apps 

/home 
contains personal directory of all users 

/root 
the home directory of root user 

/var -logs 
where variable data such as logs and databases are stored


/boot 
holds files needed for system bootup ,including the linux kernel .
An initial RAM Disk image, bootloader configuration like (GRUB)

/dev -devices 
The directory contains device files which represent and provide access 
to hardware devices such as hard drives, sound devices , etc .

/lib /lib64
contains esssential shared libraries and kernel modules that are needed 
to boot the system and run the commands

/media
this is mount point for removable media 

/mnt 
this is traditional mount point where system administrator can mount temporary file systems 
while using or configuring them 

/opt 
intended for the installation of add on application software packages.
Large software packages that are not of the default installation can be placed here to avoid 
cluttering the system directories 

/proc 
A virtual and dynamic directory as it only exists in memory .It does not use disk space .it contains information 
about system resources , hardware and running process ,Its a pseudo filesystem that provides and interface to 
kernel data structures 

cpu info
mem info

/run 
A temporary file system that stores transient state files ,like process ids or lock files , since it is cleared
and recreated at every boot 

/sbin 
contains binary(Executable) files that are mostly needed by the system administrator, these include system management commands like 
fdisk , shutdown , ip etc 

/srv 
contains data which servers hosted on the system may need ,such as web pages started by  a web server 

/sys 
similar to proc ,this is virtual file system that provides an interface to the kernel , it contains information and settings 
about the system devices , drivers and some kernel features 

/usr - Unix system resource 
which is not a user 
Conisedered the secondary hierarchy becuase it contains all user applications and
variety of other things for day to day operations , including libraries , documentation and much more 
Subdirectories include /usr/bin,user/sbin,usr/local,usr/share among others 



###Change ownership 
File ownership commands 
chwon , chgrp
chown - to change user owenership 
chgrp - to change group ownership 

user, group , other user 
rw rw rw 

chown -c nick testfile 
ownership will be chaged from paul to nick 

chgrp -c nick testfile 
group will be changed to nick of testfile 
 

####FTP###7 Feb 2025 #############
The file transfer protocol is a communication protocol user for transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network

####Linux hard and soft links 
ln - linkname command 
A connection between filename and actual data on disk 

file in long locaion 
cat mul/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4 
ln -s pathtofile newname 
we can read using shortcut file 

we can create multiple links for file softlink 

SoftLink - Link will be removed if original file is deleted or removed 
we can edit file using softlink 

inode number will be different for softlink files 
if we delete original file. softlink will be broken 

HardLink: 
Deleting renaming or removing the original file will not effect the link 

ln myfile my_file_hardlink 

only -s is missing 
inode will be same 
filename is not of type l 

if we delete orinal file also in hardlink , linked file will not get deleted

Usecase - config.xml 
we will change config version links 
as configs will be changing 


########File permissions
rwx - read, write , executable 

(user)(group)(other)

How to modify permissions of file ?
#chmod a+rwx file.txt
#chmod a-rwx file.txt
u user
g group 
o other 
a all 
chmod u+x script.sh 
chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file.txt

Recursively upate the file permissions
chmod -R u+x mydir 

Numerical Method (Octal ) 
#chmod 777 file.txt 
#chmod 644 file.txt 

000 no permissions 
every number has a meaning 
0 -7 
1-execute only 
7 read , write and execute (4+2+1)

###Manange ownership 
chown user:group filename 
chown paul:QA file.txt 
chgrp paul rfile.txt 

###File permissions with access control list 
why we need ACL ?
as we have chmod , chgrp ,chown 

what is ACL ?
It allows you to give more specific set of permission to a file or directory without 
changing the base ownership and permissions .
commands : setfacl & getfacl
setfile acl 
getfacl testfile 

ex : setfact -m u:nick:rw testfile 

+ indicates ACL is used 

###ps command 
process status command
ps 

pid 
terminal type of user logged in 
cpu time 

ps -ef | more 
ps aux | more 

ps -ef | grep httpd

ps -u username
ps -G groupname 

process tree 
ps -ejH 

###kill command 
used to terminate procee manaually 
kill signal no pid 
kill -9 PID
restrt,
kill
15 gracefully terminate 

Terminated 


###disk size commands
8-Feb 2025 
df -h
du -h /home/paul/scripts 
free  command 
Display amount of free and used memory in the system 
free -h 
free -h 10sec
Keep refreshing after 10 secs 

free means RAM
du means physical memory

####service management 
sudo systemctl start/stop <service_name>
-start of stop a service 

-to check status 
sudo systemctl status <service_name>

-to restart service 
sudo systemctl restart <service_name>

-to enable and start at same time
sudo systemctl enable -new sshd 

###sticky bit 
Restricted deletion flag or sticky bit 
Only file owner , directory owner can delete or rename a file or directory 


t or T 

chmod o+t filename

it will not allow user to delete file 

###How to change default file permissions ( 8 -Feb -2025) 

umask : 
0022
Permission = 0777 - 0022 = 755 

umask -S 

change default permission using command
umask u+rw,g+w,o+wx 

once we logout , the umask gets reverted to default permissions

To change the default permission permanently 
Add the permission in .bashrc file 

make change in .bashrc file
and souce .bashrc file 

This is how we will change default ownership fo user .


####netstat - network monitoring and troubleshooting 
network statistics 
-network connections for tcp udp
-routing tabes 
-a number of network interface 
-network protocol statistics

Case1 :port is not open - so he kill the process running on 12345 port 
and now he can connect 

netstat -an | grep 12345 


Case2 : Apache webserver is down 

Case 3 : to identify number of connections on a given port 
netstat -putan | grep <port/IP> 	

process, udp , tcp , all , numerrc 

netstat -putan | grep :22 
check for ssh 



#######9-Feb-2025 #########
Alias in Linux to boost productivity :
A custom shortcut that represents 
a longer command
series of commands 
alias shortname="your command"
alias l =  ls

alias -p
lists all alias commands 

tar -czvf backup1.tar.gz arc/ 

rm -i filedelete
i means interactive 

aliases are temporary 

 to make it permanent 
 save in .bash_profile 
 
 to immediately make it work 
 use source command
 
 to make it global change update in 
 /etc/bashrc 
 
Benefits of using alias 
-save times and efforts
-increase productivity 
-reduce risk of errors 
-improved readability

file compression 
File compression reduces the size of files by encoding their data more efficiently 
	
This is especially used for backup , storage and transfer 

gzip data.txt
1.9gb to 1.9mb 

gunzip data.txt.gz
it will get uncompressed 

#create a tar archive 
tar -cvf archive_name.tar file1.txt file2.txt 

tar -cvf backup.tar backup [tar for folder backup]
we can compress folder using above command 

gzip backup.tar now 

again compressing newly generated file .
backup.tar.gz 

commonly used format 
c - compress
extract 
z for extract 

tar -xvf backup.tar.gz

tar -czvf backup - archive and zip in single command 
tar -xzvf - to decompress 

one more command 
zip command 
zip files.zip file1 file2 
unzip archive_name.zip 

better to use tar compared to gz . as it saves files modified date and ownership etc .
