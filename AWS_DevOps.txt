6.Code Commit - Overview 
AWS Code Commit 
Git Repo - underlying technology 

7.Code Commit - ##########Hands on############## Part 1 
Can view code commit UI here .
Create repo - my_nodejs_app
Connection Steps - ssh - https 
if we are using root we will not see SSH 
-Upload a index.html file to repo 
-provide author name , email address and first commit message .
master - main 
options - pull request 
Compare commit 
Branch - Create - dev branch from master 
Creating Notifications.
Setting up Notifications 
AWS SNS 

8.Code Commit - ##########Hands on############## Part 2
Go to IAM and generate HTTPS Git Credentials .
Download the file
Install git on mac or windows 
git --version 
git clone https://-----/---/
enter username and password

Now will have ne folder my_nodejs_app 
in master branch we can see index.html file.

Now we established connectivity to git repository code commit and our computer.
Copy the required files to the directory 
use cp command.

git status

few files not added 

git add
git commit
git push 

git merge 
git revert commit hash 

9.Code Commit - Advanced.

Create a new pipeline 
Code Pipeline required new service role - as it connects s3,beanstalk,ec2 ,code commit etc.

Sources -? AWS CodeCommit , Amazon ECR , Amazon S3 ,Github 

Select repo name
branch name 

Buid stage - AWS CodeBuild or Jenkins 

We will skip build stage here .(explained very well in code build)

Deploy - [ Cloud Formation , Code Deploy ,Elastic Beanstalk , Serice catalogue , ecs, ecs blue/green, s3 

here use beanstalk

will deploy in test env 

Will create pipeline.

Once Deployed in web app - color changes from green to blue .

Now will add one more step to code pipline
deploy - deploy to prod env 

Stages have multiple action group ** 

Change background color from blue to red in index.html 
commit the change.

REview and provide manual approval to deploy in prod.

Red code will be deployed to prod now.

Enable Amazon Macie on the selected S3 buckets. Setup alerting using CloudWatch Events

Amazon Macie is a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie automatically detects a large and growing list of sensitive data types, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. It also gives you constant visibility of the data security and data privacy of your data stored in Amazon S3.

AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. Chef and Puppet are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configurations of your servers. OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments.

As mentioned in the explanation above, Secrets Manager does NOT support DynamoDB, so this option is incorrect.
 
You cannot modify an AWS managed IAM policy, so this option is incorrect.
  
When a new API route is implemented, you must create a new API Gateway stage and NOT a Lambda alias. Lambda aliases are only used to update the behavior of an existing route. Remember that one route in API Gateway is mapped to one AWS Lambda function (or another service).

CloudWatch Event Rule does not support CodeDeploy as a target, therefore CodeDeploy must be invoked from your CodePipeline.

ECR credentials must be acquired using IAM roles and CLI helpers on CodeBuild, not environment variables, especially not via your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

Use Amazon CloudWatch cross-account observability to set up a security and operations account as the monitoring account and link it with the rest of the member accounts of the organization using AWS Organizations

With Amazon CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.

Set up one or more AWS accounts as monitoring accounts and link them with multiple source accounts. A monitoring account is a central AWS account that can view and interact with observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual AWS account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account.

The shared observability data can include the following types of telemetry: 1. Metrics in Amazon CloudWatch 
2. Log groups in Amazon CloudWatch Logs 
3. Traces in AWS X-Ray

There are two options for linking source accounts to your monitoring account. You can use one or both options. 
1. Use AWS Organizations to link accounts in an organization or organizational unit to the monitoring account. 
2. Connect individual AWS accounts to the monitoring account.

AWS recommends that you use Organizations so that new AWS accounts created later in the organization are automatically onboarded to cross-account observability as source accounts. This is our use case requirement and hence choosing Organizations to implement the requirements.

You should note that you can only set up a filter policy on an SNS subscription and NOT on the SNS topic itself. In addition, it is wasteful to set up Amazon EventBridge rule on all AWS Config managed rules, rather than only the restricted-ssh rule. Therefore, both these options are incorrect.

Service Control Policies (SCP)
• Define allowlist or blocklist IAM actions
• Applied at the OU or Account level
• Does not apply to the Management Account
• SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles in the account, including Root user
• The SCP does not affect Service-linked roles
• Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations 
and can't be restricted by SCPs.
• SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
• Use cases:
• Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)

• Account Factory – easily configure new accounts to adhere to config. and policies
• Organizational Units (OUs) – group and categorize accounts based on purpose
• Service Control Policies (SCPs) – enforce fine-grained permissions and 
restrictions
• IAM Identity Center – centrally manage user access to accounts and services
• Guardrails – rules and policies to enforce security, compliance and best practices
• AWS Config – to monitor and assess your resources’ compliance with Guardrails

WAF is not for DDoS protection
• Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List):
• Rules can include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
• Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
• Size constraints, Geo match
• Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events)
• Rule Actions: Count | Allow | Block | CAPTCHA

• Run Command
• State Manager
• Patch Manager

We need to install the SSM agent onto the systems we control
• Installed by default on Amazon Linux 2 AMI & some Ubuntu AMI
• If an instance can’t be controlled with SSM, it’s probably an issue with the SSM agent!
• Make sure the EC2 instances have a proper IAM role to allow SSM actions

AWS Lambda Versions
• When you work on a Lambda function, we work on $LATEST
• When we’re ready to publish a Lambda function, we create a version
• Versions are immutable
• Versions have increasing version numbers
• Versions get their own ARN (AmazonResource Name)
• Version = code + configuration (nothing can be changed - immutable)
• Each version of the lambda function can be accessed

alias - mutable 
versions - immutable 

AWS Lambda Aliases
249 - Diagram 
• Aliases are ”pointers” to Lambda function versions
• We can define a “dev”, ”test”, “prod” aliases and have them point 
at different lambda versions
• Aliases are mutable
• Aliases enable Canary deployment by assigning weights to lambda 
functions
• Aliases enable stable configuration of our event triggers / destinations
• Aliases have their own ARNs 
• Aliases cannot reference aliases

Lambda Environment Variables
• Environment variable = key / value pair in “String” form
• Adjust the function behavior without updating code
• The environment variables are available to your code
• Lambda Service adds its own system environment variables as well
• Helpful to store secrets (encrypted by KMS) 
• Secrets can be encrypted by the Lambda service key, or your own CMK

Lambda Concurrency and Throttling(251)
• Concurrency limit: up to 1000 concurrent executions
• Can set a “reserved concurrency” at the function level (=limit)
• Each invocation over the concurrency limit will trigger a “Throttle”
• Throttle behavior:
• If synchronous invocation => return ThrottleError - 429
• If asynchronous invocation => retry automatically and then go to DLQ
• If you need a higher limit, open a support ticket

Lambda Concurrency Issue 252 (throttle issue ) Refer Diagram 

Concurrency and Asynchronous Invocations
• If the function doesn't have enough concurrency available to process all events, additional requests are throttled. 
• For throttling errors (429) and system errors (500-series), Lambda 
returns the event to the queue and attempts to run the function again 
for up to 6 hours. 
-The retry interval increases exponentially from 1 second after 
the first attempt to a maximum of 5 minutes.

Cold Starts & Provisioned Concurrency
• Cold Start:
• New instance => code is loaded and code outside the handler run (init)
• If the init is large (code, dependencies, SDK…) this process can take some time. 
• First request served by new instances has higher latency than the rest

• Provisioned Concurrency:
• Concurrency is allocated before the function is invoked (in advance)
• So the cold start never happens and all invocations have low latency
• Application Auto Scaling can manage concurrency (schedule or target utilization)

In Lambda, concurrency is the number of in-flight requests that your function is currently handling. There are two types of concurrency controls available:

Reserved concurrency – This represents the maximum number of concurrent instances allocated to your function. When a function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. Reserved concurrency is useful for ensuring that your most critical functions always have enough concurrency to handle incoming requests. Configuring reserved concurrency for a function incurs no additional charges.

Provisioned concurrency – This is the number of pre-initialized execution environments allocated to your function. These execution environments are ready to respond immediately to incoming function requests. Provisioned concurrency is useful for reducing cold start latencies for functions. Configuring provisioned concurrency incurs additional charges to your AWS account.



Lambda – File Systems Mounting
• Lambda functions can access EFS file systems if they are running in a VPC
Configure Lambda to mount EFS file systems to local directory during 
initialization Must leverage EFS Access Points
• Limitations: watch out for the EFS connection limits (one function instance = one connection) and connection burst limits

Example: Building a Serverless API -259 


AWS API Gateway
• AWS Lambda + API Gateway: No infrastructure to manage
 • Support for the WebSocket Protocol 
 • Handle API versioning (v1, v2…) 
 • Handle different environments (dev, test, prod…) 
 • Handle security (Authentication and Authorization)
 • Create API keys, handle request throttling
 • Swagger / Open API import to quickly define APIs 
 • Transform and validate requests and responses
 • Generate SDK and API specifications 
 • Cache API responses

API Gateway – Integrations High Level
• Lambda Function
	• Invoke Lambda function 
	• Easy way to expose REST API backed by AWS Lambda
• HTTP
	• Expose HTTP endpoints in the backend 
	• Example: internal HTTP API on premise, Application Load Balancer…
	• Why? Add rate limiting, caching, user authentications, API keys, etc… 
• AWS Service
	• Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway
	• Example: start an AWS Step Function workflow, post a message to SQS
	• Why? Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate control…
	
API Gateway – AWS Service Integration Kinesis Data Streams example

API Gateway - Endpoint Types (Edge Optimized , Regional , Private )

API Gateway – Security 

• User Authentication through
	• IAM Roles (useful for internal applications)
	• Cognito (identity for external users – example mobile users)
	• Custom Authorizer (your own logic)
	
• Custom Domain Name HTTPS security through integration with AWS 
Certificate Manager (ACM)
	• If using Edge-Optimized endpoint, then the certificate must be in us-east-1
	• If using Regional endpoint, the certificate must be in the API Gateway region
	• Must setup CNAME or A-alias record in Route 53
	
API Gateway – Deployment Stages
• Making changes in the API Gateway does not mean they’re effective
• You need to make a “deployment” for them to be in effect
• It’s a common source of confusion
• Changes are deployed to “Stages” (as many as you want)
• Use the naming you like for stages (dev, test, prod)
• Each stage has its own configuration parameters
• Stages can be rolled back as a history of deployments is kept
stages ( dev , prod , test)

API Gateway – Stage Variables 
• Stage variables are like environment variables for API Gateway

API Gateway Stage Variables & Lambda Aliases -268 diagram 
API Gateway – Canary Deployment

API Gateway - Open API spec
• Using OpenAPI we can generate SDK for our applications

REST API – Request Validation

Caching API responses
• Caching reduces the number of calls made to the backend
• Default TTL (time to live) is 300 seconds (min: 0s, max: 3600s)
• Caches are defined per stage

API Gateway Cache Invalidation
• Clients can invalidate the cache with header: Cache- Control: max-age=0 (with proper IAM authorization


API Gateway – Logging & Tracing
• CloudWatch Logs
	• Log contains information about request/response body
	• Enable CloudWatch logging at the Stage level (with Log Level - ERROR, DEBUG, INFO)
	• Can override settings on a per API basis
	
• X-Ray
	• Enable tracing to get extra information about requests in API Gateway 
	• X-Ray API Gateway + AWS Lambda gives you the full picture

API Gateway – CloudWatch Metrics
• 4XXError (client-side) & 5XXError (server-side)

API Gateway Throttling
• Account Limit 
	• API Gateway throttles requests at 10000 rps across all API
	• Soft limit that can be increased upon request
	• In case of throttling => 429 Too Many Requests (retriable error)
	• Can set Stage limit & Method limits to improve performance
	• Or you can define Usage Plans to throttle per customer
	
API Gateway - Errors

Amazon ECS - EC2 Launch Type
• ECS = Elastic Container Service
• Launch Docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters
• EC2 Launch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
• Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
• AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers

Amazon ECS – Fargate Launch Type
• Launch Docker containers on AWS
• You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage)
• It’s all Serverless!
• You just create task definitions
• AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need
• To scale, just increase the number of tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances

Amazon ECS – IAM Roles for ECS
• EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only): 
	• Used by the ECS agent
	• Makes API calls to ECS service
	• Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
	• Pull Docker image from ECR
	• Reference sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
	
• ECS Task Role:
	• Allows each task to have a specific role
	• Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
	• Task Role is defined in the task definition
	
Amazon ECS – Load Balancer Integrations(ALB and NLB)Supported 

Amazon ECS – Data Volumes (EFS)
• Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
• Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
• Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file system
• Fargate + EFS = Serverless
• Use cases: persist

Amazon ECS Auto Scaling uses AWS Application Auto Scaling

Fargate + EFS = Serverless 
Lambda + EFS 
No S3 
• ECS Service Auto Scaling (task level) ≠ EC2 Auto Scaling (EC2 instance level)

Cloudwatch metric is used here to scale 
ECS tasks invoked by Event Bridge
ECS – SQS Queue Example
ECS – Intercept Stopped Tasks using EventBridge
ECS – Logging with “awslogs” driver
• You need to turn on awslogs log driver (for CW Logs)
• Fargate Launch Type
• EC2 Launch Type
Enable logging using ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS in 
/etc/ecs/ecs.config
Cloudwatch logs 

ECS – Logging with Sidecar Container
Using a sidecar container which is responsible for collecting logs from all other containers and files on the file system and send the logs to a log storage (e.g., CloudWatch Logs)

Amazon ECR
• Fully integrated with ECS, backed by Amazon S3
Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning,image tags, image lifecycle..
Amazon ECR – Uniform Pipeline295 - Diagram 
Amazon EKS Overview
It’s an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API

Amazon EKS – Data Volumes
• Support for…
• Amazon EBS
• Amazon EFS (works with Fargate)
• Amazon FSx for Lustre
• Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

Amazon EKS – Control Plane Logging

• Use the Fluent Bit, or Fluentd log drivers to send logs to CloudWatch Log awslogs driver for ECS 
• Use CloudWatch Container Insights to get a dashboarding monitoring solution for nodes, pods, tasks, and services

Kinesis Overview-302
• Kinesis Data Streams: capture, process, and store data streams
• Kinesis Data Firehose: ##load## data streams into AWS data stores
• Kinesis Data Analytics: analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink

Kinesis Data Streams – Capacity Modes
Provisioned Mode 
Ondemand Mode 
• IteratorAgeMilliseconds = 0, then records being read are completely caught up with the Stream
• IteratorAgeMilliseconds > 0 means we’re not processing the records fast enough

Amazon Route 53
• Each record contains:
	• Domain/subdomain Name – e.g., example.com
	• Record Type – e.g., A or AAAA
	• Value – e.g., 12.34.56.78
	• Routing Policy – how Route 53 responds to queries
	• TTL – amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers

• Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
• (must know) A / AAAA / CNAME / NS

• A – maps a hostname to IPv4
• AAAA – maps a hostname to IPv6
• CNAME – maps a hostname to another hostname
• The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
• Can’t create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
• Example: you can’t create for example.com, but you can create for 
www.example.com
• NS – Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
• Control how traffic is routed for a domain


Routing Policies – Weighted -320
Routing Policies – Latency-based
Routing Policies – Failover (Active-Passive)

RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
• Up to 15 Read Replicas
• Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
• Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
• Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
• Applications must update the connection string to leverage read 
replicas

RDS Read Replicas – Use Cases
• Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements 
(not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

RDS Read Replicas – Network Cost 
• In AWS there’s a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another 
• For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don’t pay that fee

RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
• One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
Read replica is not same DNS

AWS Application Auto Scaling 
• Monitors your apps and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at lowest cost
• Setup scaling for multiple resouces across multiple services from a single place 
(no need to navigate across different services)
• Point to your app and select the services and resources you want to scale 
(no need to setup alarms and scaling actions for each service)
• Search for resources/services using CloudFormation Stack, Tags, or EC2 ASG
• Build Scaling Plans to automatically add/remove capacity from your resources in real-time as demand changes
• Supports Target Tracking, Step, and Scheduled Scaling 

ASG - Dynamo Table 
ALB Listener Rules 

ELB – DualStack Networking

• Allows clients communicate with the ELB using both IPv4 and IPv6
• Supports both ALB and NLB
• ALB and NLB can have mixed IPv4 and IPv6 targets in separate target groups.
• ELB DualStack ensures compatibility between client and target IP versions
• IPv4 clients communicate with IPv4 targets, and IPv6 clients communicate with IPv6 targets.
• If you only have IPv4 targets, the ELB automatically converts requests from IPv6 to IPv4
• Note: AZ must be added/enabled for instances to receive traffic

NLB – PrivateLink Integration

Exposing Service in VPCs with Overlapping IP addresses
(instead of VPC Peering)

NAT Gateway :

• AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
• Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
• NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
• Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other 
subnets)
• Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
• 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps
• No Security Groups to manage / required
393 - diagram 

NAT Gateway is resilient within a single Availability Zone
• Must create multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs for fault-tolerance
• There is no cross-AZ failover needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT

Multi AZ in AWS

Multi Region Services
• DynamoDB Global Tables (multi-way replication, enabled by Streams)
• AWS Config Aggregators (multi region & multi account)
• RDS Cross Region Read Replicas (used for Read & DR)
• Aurora Global Database (one region is master, other is for Read & DR)
• EBS volumes snapshots, AMI, RDS snapshots can be copied to other regions
• VPC peering to allow private traffic between regions
• Route53 uses a global network of DNS servers
• S3 Cross Region Replication
• CloudFront for Global CDN at the Edge Locations
• Lambda@Edge for Global Lambda function at Edge Locations (A/B testing)

• Trigger Auto Scaling Action
• Send notification to SNS (from which you can do pretty much anything)

CloudWatch Alarms – Composite Alarms

EC2 Instance Recovery

• Status Check:
	• Instance status = check the EC2 VM
	• System status = check the underlying hardware
	
• Alarms can be created based on CloudWatch Logs Metrics Filters
• To test alarms and notifications, set the alarm state to Alarm using CLI
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value 
ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes"

CloudWatch Synthetics Canary-439 
• Configurable script that monitor your APIs, URLs, Websites...
• Reproduce what your customers do programmatically to find issues before customers are impacted
• Checks the availability and latency of your endpoints and can store load time data and screenshots of the UI
• Integration with CloudWatch Alarms
• Scripts written in Node.js or Python
• Programmatic access to a headless Google Chrome browser
• Can run once or on a regular schedule

CloudWatch Synthetics Canary Blueprints
• Heartbeat Monitor – load URL, store screenshot and an HTTP archive file
• API Canary – test basic read and write functions of REST APIs
• Broken Link Checker – check all links inside the URL that you are testing
• Visual Monitoring – compare a screenshot taken during a canary run with a baseline screenshot
• Canary Recorder – used with CloudWatch Synthetics Recorder (record your actions on a website and automatically generates a script for that)
• GUI Workflow Builder – verifies that actions can be taken on your webpage (e.g., test a webpage with a login form

Amazon Athena+Quiclsight 
Serverless Query -S3 -SQL 

Use cases: Business intelligence / analytics / reporting, analyze & 
query VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrail trails, etc... 
• Exam Tip: analyze data in S3 using serverless SQL, use Athena

Amazon Athena – Performance Improvement
• Use columnar data for cost-savings (less scan)
• Apache Parquet or ORC is recommended
• Huge performance improvement
• Use Glue to convert your data to Parquet or ORC
• Compress data for smaller retrievals (bzip2, gzip, lz4, snappy, zlip, zstd…)
• Partition datasets in S3 for easy querying on virtual columns
• s3://yourBucket/pathToTable /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE> /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE> /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>
 /etc…
• Example: s3://athena-examples/flight/parquet/year=1991/month=1/day=1/
• Use larger files (> 128 MB) to minimize overhead

Amazon Athena – Federated Query

#########Domain 5 – Incident and Event Response
Amazon EventBridge(formerly CloudWatch Events)
445-cron jobs, event pattern ,
trigger lambda functions , SQS and SNS 
446 - source and destinations 

Event Bridge Schema Registry 
The Schema Registry allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus

• Example: allow/deny events from another AWS account or AWS region
• Use case: aggregate all events from your AWS Organization in a single AWS

S3 Event Notifications
• S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, 
S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication…
451

• EventBridge Capabilities – Archive, Replay Events, Reliable delivery

Amazon S3 – Object Integrity 
--Using MD5
--Other supported checksums: SHA-1, SHA-256, CRC32, CRC32C

AWS Health Dashboard - Service History
• Shows all regions, all services health
• Shows historical information for each day
• Has an RSS feed you can subscribe to
• Previously called AWS Service Health Dashboard

454

AWS Health Dashboard –Your Account
• Previously called AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD)
• AWS Account Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation 
guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.
Service Health Dashboard
Account Health Dashboard

Health Event Notifications
Example: receive email notifications when EC2 instances in your AWS account are scheduled for updates

AWS Health Dashboard – Examples
458 

Status Checks
• Automated checks to identify hardware and software issues
459 
system - new host 
instance - software issues 

Status Checks - CW Metrics & Recovery

AWS CloudTrail
• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
• Console
• SDK
• CLI
• AWS Services
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
• If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!

Inspect and audit - S3 or Cloudwatch logs -462 

CloudTrail Events
• Management Events
• Data Events
• CloudTrail Insights Events

• Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
• inaccurate resource provisioning 
• hitting service limits
• Bursts of AWS IAM actions
• Gaps in periodic maintenance activity
• CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
• And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns
• Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
• Event is sent to Amazon S3
• An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)

• Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
• To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena

466 
Amazon EventBridge + CloudTrail

Amazon SQS – Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)-468 
• If a consumer fails to process a message within the Visibility Timeout…
the message goes back to the queue!
• We can set a threshold of how many times a message can 
go back to the queue 
• After the MaximumReceives threshold is exceeded, the message goes into a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
• Useful for debugging!
• DLQ of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue
• DLQ of a Standard queue must also be a Standard queue
• Make sure to process the messages in the DLQ before they expire: 
• Good to set a retention of 14 days in the DLQ

SQS DLQ – Redrive to Source
• DLQ is attached to SNS Subscription-level (rather than the SNS Topic) 
DLQ ( HTTP and Lambda ) - 470 

AWS X -Ray -471 
Visual analysis of our applications
• Tracing requests across your microservices (distributed systems)
• Integrations with:
• EC2 – install the X-Ray agent
• ECS – install the X-Ray agent or Docker container
• Lambda
• Beanstalk - agent is automatically installed
• API Gateway – helpful to debug errors (such as 504)
• The X-Ray agent or services need IAM permissions to X-Ray

X-Ray with Elastic Beanstalk
• AWS Elastic Beanstalk platforms include the X-Ray daemon
• You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk console or with a configuration file (in .ebextensions/xray-daemon.config)

Xray ==== Distro 
AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
• Collects distributed traces and metrics from your apps
Migrate from X-Ray to AWS Distro for Temeletry if you want to standardize with open-source APIs from Telemetry or send traces to multiple destinations simultaneousy

OrganizationAccountAccessRole is already created when invited from other account 
AWS Control Tower Blue print Role to access service catalogues 
Immutable deployment in EB provides rollback safety 
S3 Batch operations - Initial sync 
CRR - for later 
SCP permission - broad organization wise policy - not individual resources like EC2 
Least privilige | best practice |means iam role | Temp credentials 
xray - troubleshoot - trace 
we can use amazon efs utils pacakge to mount EFS - 
insted of NFS mount 
EC2 image builder can also be used for container images .
Use replicate ecr images insted of copying to diff regions due to security concerns.
Basic scanning covers only OS vulnerabilities and not package vulnerabilities
ECS can also be incuded in code pipeline
There is no such thing as a SecureString value in AWS Secrets Manager.
Secure string in only AWS Systems manager 

It is considered a bad practice to store hard-coded database credentials in code, configuration, or build files such as the buildspec.yaml file. As a security best practice, AWS recommends using the database password as a SecureString value in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store which can then be referenced in the buildspec file like so:

Amazon FSx for NetApp ontap
Multi-protocol access to data using the Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) protocols

Terminate Wait is correct not pending 
Use most common wait status 
 
X-Ray is for Distributed Tracing 
NAT Gateway - Private Link or VPC Endpoints for private connections 
AWS Ops Work - COnfig mgmt service 
ASG using lifecycle events updates about failed ec2 launch 
AWS Config can deploy AWS config performance packs
Systems Manager Invetory to identify softwares in ec2 
Assumption is done only by execution role and not by pricipal 
potentialy compromized ec2 instances, suspecious nw activity and unusual api activity - GuardDuty 
Explicit allow are easy to maintaing then deny policies 
VPC peering required for cross account connections for lambda to perform functions - EFS connection 
Code deploy does not support canary deployments for lambda

###AWS VPC Explained 
To securely isolate and control network environments

VPC CIDR Block 
When you create a VPC , you specify a CIDR block that defined the IP Address range for the Entire VPC 
For Example  : 

10.0.0.0/16
This blocks allows for 65536 IP Addresses, But in reality 65,531 are usable addresses
CIDR [Classless InterDomain Routing] is a method for allocating IP Addresses and routing Internet protocol packets 

A subnet is a smaller , segmented part of a larger network that isolates and organizes devices within a specific IP address range 

instances will be created inside subnet 

public subnet 10.0.0.0/24
private subnet 10.0.1.0/24

subnet will be created in AZ 

Subnet CIDR Blocks 

Routing Table 
Routing table is set of rules called routes .that are used to dertermine whether network traffic from your subnets or gateway is directed 
Each subnet from your VPC  must be associated with a route table , which controls ther routing of the subnet .

Internet Gateway : 
An Internet gateway is a component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet .

Security Groups:-works on instance level 
Network firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances .

Security group contains inbound and outbound rules 
inbound - enable http and https 

Network ACLs ( Access Control Lists)- works on subnet level 
Optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets 

Allow or Deny Rule 

NAT ( Network Address Translator ) Gateway :
Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS Services .but prevents the internet from initiating 
connection to those instances 

VPC Peering 
A networking connection between 2 VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately 

VPC Endpoints 
Allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS Private Link 

Bastion Hosts : 
A special purpose instance that provides secure access to your instances in private subnet 


Elastic IP Addresses : 
Static IP Addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing 

VPC Flow Logs : 
Captures Information about the IP Traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC 

Direct Connect : 
Establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS 

AWS Client VPN : 
Managed VPN service that enables secure remote access to AWS resurces and on premise networks using Open VPN based clients 

####Manual VPC Cretion 
Create new VPC
created 2 subnets
1 public and another private .

Create route table 
Create Internet Gateway 

####VPC Creation using TF
A VPC with CIDR Block of 10.0.0.0/16
One public subnet with CIDR block of 10.0.1.0/24
One private subnet with CIDR block of 10.0.2.0/24 
One Internet Gateway 
One public route table with a route to the Internet Gateway , and the correct association between public subnet and public route table 

everything will be created in aws-vpc folder 
In new folder will perform terraform init
